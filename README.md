Final project for GA Data Science Course using Airbnb Kaggle data to predict country of first reservation given user traffic on the website.

1. What is the question you hope to answer?

My main goal for this project is to work with user or product activity data of some sort that will be similar to what I will be working with at a consumer focused tech company. I want to answer some question that predicts something about the user experience or user behavior.

In the case of the Airbnb data, I would be looking at user data to predict what the country of first reservation will be.

2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

A data set provided by Airbnb that has both user info and a large log of session data.

3. What do you know about the data so far?

I have had the chance to browse through. The user data is straight forward about where the new user came from, language, etc. The session data will be much more difficult to parse through. It is a 600mb file. The others are < 25mb.

4. Why did you choose this topic? 

See above. I really wanted somthing that would translate to real world needs at a tech company.
